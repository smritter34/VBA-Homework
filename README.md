# VBAhomework 
The purpose of this module was to create a script that could loop through a dataset that contains stock values and 
performances of companies in various industries in order to show which companies performed the best and worst.
The script looped through the dataset to create a visualization of which companies had the greatest increase and greatest
decrease in stock volume as well as showing the company greatest total volume. We also used conditional formatting to color code 
the vizualization.
